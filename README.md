## INTRODUCTION
Its development was started in 1991 by Linus
Torvalds. The operating system was inspired by Unix, another operating system developed in the
1970s by AT&T Laboratories.
Linux is not backed by an individual company but by
an international community of programmers. As it is freely available, it can be used by anyone without restrictions.

### Distribution
A Linux distribution is a bundle that consists of a Linux kernel and a selection of applications that are maintained by a company or user community.
A distribution’s goal is to optimize the kernel
and the applications that run on the operating system for a certain use case or user group.
This is why some distributions are mainly used for desktop environments where they need to be easy to use while others are mainly used to run on servers to use the available resources as efficiently as possible.
Another way to classify distributions is by referring to the distribution family they belong to.
Distributions of the Debian distribution family use the package manager dpkg to manage the software that is run on the operating system.
Maintainers use
the deb package format to specify how the software is installed on the operating system and how it is configured by default.
Just like a distribution, a package is a bundle of software and a
corresponding configuration and documentation that makes it easier for the user to install, update and use the software.

The Debian GNU/Linux distribution is the biggest distribution of the Debian distribution family.
It also promotes Richard Stallman’s vision of an operating system that respects
the freedoms of the user to run, study, distribute and improve the software. This is why it does not provide any proprietary software by default.

Ubuntu is another Debian-based distribution worth mentioning. Ubuntu was created by Mark Shuttleworth and his team in 2004, with the mission to bring an easy to use Linux desktop environment. Ubuntu’s mission is to provide a free software to everyone across the world as well as to cut the cost of professional services. The distribution has a scheduled release every six months with a long-term support release every 2 years.

Red Hat is a Linux distribution developed and maintained by the identically named software company, which was acquired by IBM in 2019. The Red Hat Linux distribution was started in 1994 and re-branded in 2003 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, often abbreviated as RHEL. It is provided to companies as a reliable enterprise solution that is supported by Red Hat and comes with software
that aims to ease the use of Linux in professional server environments. Some of its components require fee-based subscriptions or licenses. The CentOS project uses the freely available source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and compiles it to a distribution which is available completely free of charge, but in return does not come with commercial support. 
Both RHEL and CentOS are optimized for use in server environments. The Fedora project was founded in 2003 and creates a Linux distribution which is aimed at desktop computers. Red Hat initiated and maintains the Fedora distribution ever since. Fedora is very progressive and adopts new technologies very quickly and is sometimes considered a test-bed for new technologies which later might be included in RHEL. All Red Hat based distributions use the package format rpm.

The company SUSE was founded in 1992 in Germany as a Unix service provider. The first version of SUSE Linux was released in 1994. Over the years SUSE Linux became mostly known for its YaST configuration tool. This tool allows administrators to install and configure software and hardware, set up servers and networks. Similar to RHEL, SUSE releases SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, which is their commercial edition. This is less frequently released and is suitable for enterprise and production deployment. It is distributed as a server as well as a desktop environment, with fit-for-purpose packages. In 2004, SUSE released the openSUSE project, which opened opportunities for developers and users to test and further develop the system. The openSUSE distribution is freely available to download.

Independent distributions have been released over the years. Some of them are based on either Red Hat or Ubuntu, some are designed to improve a specific propriety of a system or hardware. There are distributions built with specific functionalities like QubesOS, a very secure desktop environment, or Kali Linux, which provides an environment for exploiting software vulnerabilities, mainly used by penetration testers. Recently various super small Linux distributions are designed to specifically run in Linux containers, such as Docker. There are also distributions built specifically for components of embedded systems and even smart devices.
